7 Days → 7 Python Projects 🐍
<hr>
This repo contains all the projects from my self-challenge where I build one Python project every day for 7 days.

🛠️ What’s inside:

    Small but practical Python projects

    A mix of useful & fun experiments

    Beginner-friendly code, focused on fundamentals

    Stepping stones toward AI/ML projects 🤖

💡 The goal: to sharpen my problem-solving skills, stay consistent with coding, and build a strong foundation before diving deeper into AI & Full Stack development.
